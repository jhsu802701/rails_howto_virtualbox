# VirtualBox Tutorial

Welcome to the VirtualBox Tutorial!  This tutorial walks you through the process of installing a Linux virtual machine with VirtualBox.

## What is a virtual machine?

## Why use VirtualBox?
VirtualBox is free and open source.  It's available for Linux, Mac, and Windows host machines.

## What's the point?
* If you are a Windows or Mac user, VirtualBox allows you to try out Linux or other operating systems WITHOUT disrupting your existing setup.
* If you are a Linux user, VirtualBox allows you to try out other Linux distros WITHOUT disrupting your existing setup.
* If you are a Linux or Mac user, you can install Windows in VirtualBox and free yourself from the hassles of Windows crashes and other problems.  You can save snapshots of your Windows installation at key points and restore these snapshots when you have problems.
* If you know the Linux way but not the Mac way or Windows way of doing something, having a Linux virtual machine bails you out of the responsibility of having to do this.  A Linux virtual machine is handy for installing Ruby on Rails on a Windows machine, getting Bash scripts to work on a Windows machine, or reinstalling Ruby on Rails on a Mac.
