# Chapter 2: Downloading the Linux ISO Image
In this chapter, you will download the ISO image of a Linux distro called SparkyLinux.

## Background
### What is an ISO Image?
An ISO image is a file archive of an optical disc.  If you want to create Linux CD or DVD to boot up a physical computer, you burn the ISO image onto a CD or DVD.  VirtualBox allows you to boot up a Linux distro on a virtual machine directly from the ISO file.  In other words, you will NOT need a Linux CD or DVD in this tutorial.

### Why do you like SparkyLinux?
* It's a quick and lightweight distro that works well on old computers and on virtual machines.
* It's based on Debian Linux.  Debian is known for having one of the largest software repositories of all Linux distros.  Because of the large user base, it's easy to find help.
* It offers a version based on Debian's stable branch, which is what you will use here.  The stable branch is known for greater stability and lower maintenance requirements than the testing and unstable branches of Debian.

## Procedure
* Go to the [SparkyLinux](https://sparkylinux.org/) web site.
* Click on "Download".
* Click on "Stable".
* Go to the LXDE Edition section, and download one of the ISO files from the OSDN web mirror.  If you have a 32-bit host OS, select the i686 non-pae version.  If you have a 64-bit host OS, pick the x86_64/amd64 version.
* Your download will be completed in a few minutes.  The next step is to verify the ISO file that you downloaded.
* Do not close your web browser window or tab yet, because you will be downloading another file from the SparkyLinux download page in the next chapter.
